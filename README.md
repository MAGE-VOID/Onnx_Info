Input and output of onnx model

ONNX is an open-source format for representing machine learning models. The script allows the user to select an ONNX model file through a file dialog. It then creates an ONNX session, retrieves information about the input and output tensors in the model, and prints this information to the console.

Here's a breakdown of the script's functionality:

File Selection:

The script prompts the user to select an ONNX model file through a file dialog.
Model Processing:

It displays a message indicating that the ONNX model file is being processed, mentioning the file name and indicating that debug logs are enabled.
ONNX Session Creation:

It creates an ONNX session using the selected model file.
If there is an error during the creation of the session, it prints an error message to the console and exits the script.
Input Information:

It retrieves and prints information about the input tensors in the ONNX model.
For each input tensor, it prints the input index, input name, and additional information retrieved using the OnnxGetInputTypeInfo function.
Output Information:

It retrieves and prints information about the output tensors in the ONNX model.
For each output tensor, it prints the output index, output name, and additional information retrieved using the OnnxGetOutputTypeInfo function.

The script is useful for inspecting the structure of ONNX models, providing insights into the input and output tensors, their names, and their properties. It is particularly helpful for debugging and understanding the characteristics of ONNX models used in machine learning applications.
